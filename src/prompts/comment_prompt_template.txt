Please help me understand this code, with line numbers added for reference:
```
{{{code_with_line_numbers}}}
```
Identify the logical sections of the code and summarize them.
Format your response by providing, for each logical section, the line number where that section starts, followed by one sentence that summarizes that section.
Do not repeat the code; just provide the summary.
